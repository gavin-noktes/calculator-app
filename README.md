# Calculator App
A simple calculator app I made for fun. No complex lexer/parser combo or anything like that. Just a simple single day project using an array in localstorage to keep track of everything.

## Usage
```bash
$ cd calculator-app

$ # for firefox users
$ firefox index.html
$ # or chrome users
$ google-chrome index.html
```
